## Task 1

Use `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` to display
your current position on a web page.

Example:

![image of longitude](./static/latlong.png)

## Task 2

Fetch your current position every 5 seconds
and update the UI to reflect the latest value

![image of longitude](./static/latlong.png)

## Task 3

Add a google map on your site.
A api-key can be found in the pptx for the lecture.
You can follow instructions how to make it on https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/google_maps_intro.asp but you'll need to figure out how
to add your current position to the map.
Hint: Here you'll need to combine the google maps api and the browser navigator api.

### Task 3.1

Add a marker at your current position.
