## Task 1

Make a function that takes in a single parameter and returns
a new promise.
Using setTimeout after 500 milliseconds the promise will either
resolve or reject. If the input parameter is a string, the promise
resolves with the same string uppercased. If the input is anything
but a string it rejects with the same input.

> ! Hint: check the pptx for clues on how to create a promise.
